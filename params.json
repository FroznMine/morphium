Some of the main Features of Morphium:\r\n- actively developed\r\n- used by a number of projects (including holidayinsider.com)\r\n- Transparent access to mongo db\r\n- Transparent declarative (Annotation based) caching\r\n- Annotation based definition of mappings\r\n- Cluster Awareness\r\n- Cache synchronization between cluster nodes\r\n- Asynchronous and Buffered write access\r\n- Messageing\r\n- fluent interface for querying mongodb\r\n- support for the mongodb aggrgator framework\r\n- support for complex queries\r\n- support inheritence and polymorphism\r\n- support for javax.validation annotations\r\n- lifecycle method of pojos\r\n- nearly every aspect of morphium can be replaced by own implementation (e.g. Query-Object, CacheImplementation...)\r\n- ConfigManager helps storing app configurations in Mongo with efficient access to it (cached)\r\n- Spport for References, including lazy loaded references\r\n- Support for partial updated objects (when writing, only the changes of the object are transferred)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick Start\r\n===========\r\n\r\nbefore accessing mongo via morphium, you need to configure morphium. this is done by preparing a MorphiumConfig Object:\r\n```java\r\n  MorphiumConfig cfg = new MorphiumConfig();\r\n  cfg.setDatabase(\"testdb\");\r\n  cfg.addHost(\"localhost\", 27017);\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou can also configure morphium using properties: new MorphiumConfig(properties); or a json-String: MorphiumConfig cfg = MorphiumConfig.createFromJson(json);\r\n\r\nAfter that, you just need to instancieate morphium:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  Morphium m=new Morphium(cfg);\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen you are good to go:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  Query<MyEntity> q=m.createQueryFor(MyEntity.class).f(\"a_field\").eq(\"a value\");\r\n  List<MyEntity> lst=q.asList();\r\n  MyEntity ent=q.get();\r\n  ...\r\n  m.store(ent);\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefining an Entity is quite simple as well:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Entity(translateCamelCase = true)\r\n  @Cache\r\n  public class MyEntity {\r\n    @Id\r\n    private ObjectId myId; \r\n  \r\n    private String aField;\r\n  \r\n    private EmbeddedObject emb;\r\n  \r\n    @Reference\r\n    private MyEntity otherEntity;\r\n  \r\n   ...\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Embedded\r\n  public class EmbeddedObject {\r\n   ...\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll entities need to have an @Id field. If the type is org.bson.types.ObjectId, it will be created by mongo, if not - you need to take care of that.\r\nReferences only work to other entities (of course).\r\nYou can also use Maps, Lists or Arrays, all may also include other Entities or Embedded types.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a very short glance at all the features of Morphium!\r\n\r\nFor more information take a closer look at http://code.google.com/p/morphium\r\n\r\nHave fun,\r\n\r\nStephan\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
